It is common to _initialize_ a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.
```js
var myVar = 0;
```
This creates a new variable called `myVar` and assigns it an initial value of `0`.

---
Define a variable `a` with `var` and initialize it to a value of `9`.

- You should initialize `a` to a value of `9`.

## ***Solution:***
```js
var a = 9;
```
