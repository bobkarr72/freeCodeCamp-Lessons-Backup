## ***JavaScript Commenting***
#### ***freeCodeCamp / JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures / Basic Javascript***

JavaScript allows for both `inline` and `multi-line` comments as shown below.

This is an example of an `inline` comment:
```js
//  This is an inline comment
```
This is an example of a `multi-line` comment:
```js
/* This is a multi-line comment and requires different annotation
than that which is required for an otherwise inline comment */
```
---
## ***Solution:***
For an `inline` comment, use the following: `//`

For a `multi-line` comment, open with `/*` and close with `*/`
